Skiing
======

Ever since my first time putting on boots and snapping into skis, I've absolutely loved the feeling of flying down the mountain and racing through powder. Here are some photos from a trip to Colorado lately.

Books, TV, and Movies

I also love watching movies and reading sci-fi and fantasy novels. Here are some of my favorites.
