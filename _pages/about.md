I recently graduated with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University. My focus area was in Biomedical Data Science, where I did a lot of work in machine learning and signal processing. I am most interested in using computational methods to enhance our understanding of the human body and natural phenomena so that we can improve the world, whether that means ensuring better patient outcomes or building methods that help us solve complex health and technological challenges.

I am a co-developer of [mvlearn](https://mvlearn.neurodata.io/), the first major open-source Python package for multiview machine learning. During my undergrad, I also conducted research in neuroscience under [Dr. Kathleen Cullen](https://thecullenlab.org/) analyzing the movements of vestibular schwannoma patients to strengthen diagnosis and rehabilitation prospects.

Since my freshman year, I have been heavily involved in biomedical design teams, and I am very proud of the progress my teams have made toward building a product that can help people in the real world. [OtoGlobal Health](https://otoglobalhealth.wixsite.com/companysite), a startup that I led for 2 years, has developed a low-cost hearing screening device for low-resource settings. I also developed a low-cost device to prevent postpartum hemorrhage in low-resource settings, a design which my teammates and I [published](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/medicaldevices/article-abstract/14/1/014503/1072514/Improved-Treatment-of-Postpartum-Hemorrhage-Design?redirectedFrom=fulltext).

Outside of academics, I love skiing, movies, and reading great fantasy and sci-fi novels. I volunteered as a ski patroller at a local ski resort during high school, where I was trained in emergency medicine and realized my passion for healthcare (and free skiing).
