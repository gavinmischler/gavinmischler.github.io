## Current Work

I am an MS/PhD student at Columbia University in the department of Electrical Engineering. I conduct research in the [Neural Acoustic Processing Lab](http://naplab.ee.columbia.edu/), under the supervision of [Dr. Nima Mesgarani](http://nima.ee.columbia.edu/). My work is at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and biology. Specifically, I am interested in modeling the representations of language and sound in the auditory cortex with the goal of understanding how different types of sounds are processed based on both innate bottom-up processing and high-level cognitive information.


## Undergraduate Experience

In 2020, I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering.

I am one of the original co-developers of [mvlearn](https://mvlearn.github.io/), the first major open-source Python package for multiview machine learning. During my undergrad, I worked on a spike inference algorithm based on FRI theory with [Dr. Benjamín Béjar](https://people.epfl.ch/benjamin.bejarharo/?lang=en), the code for which can be found [here](https://github.com/gavinmischler/spikeFRInder). I also conducted research in neuroscience under [Dr. Kathleen Cullen](https://thecullenlab.org/) analyzing the movements of vestibular schwannoma patients to understand the effects of neurectomy and neural compensation mechanism.

At JHU, I was heavily involved in biomedical design teams, and I am very proud of the progress my teams made toward building products that can help people in the real world. [OtoGlobal Health](https://otoglobalhealth.wixsite.com/companysite), a startup that I led for a little over a year, has developed a low-cost hearing screening device for low-resource settings. I also developed a low-cost device to treat postpartum hemorrhage in low-resource settings, ([details here](https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4045965)).

## Outside School

Outside of academics, I love skiing, movies, and reading great fantasy and sci-fi novels. I volunteered as a ski patroller at a local ski resort during high school, where I was trained in emergency medicine.
